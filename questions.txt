Q2) The browser shows a basic webpage with the text "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!" and a little rocketship

Q3) The root path / shows a 404 and tells us the paths that exist, /polls and /admin.
/polls shows us the text we entered in the polls/views.py file, "Hello world! You're at the polls index"

Q4) In order to update our database schema, we need to do it in the form of a migration. Whenever we add or change a model,
we create and run a migration and django can generate the proper SQL for the database.

Q5) Gives us a site administration page with tabs to add groups and users.
In the polls/admin.py file, we can register a model, and it will show up on the page similarly to the Groups and Users objects.

Q6) Whatever number we put into the path is returned in the body of the page with the strings we put into the HTTPResponses of our view methods.
If we change the type specification in the urls from int to str we can put any string value.
